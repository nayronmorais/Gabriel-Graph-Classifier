# Classifier Based on Gabriel Graph

- This repository contains the implemtation of Gabriel Graph Classifier (GCC) with some changes that was proposed
in the final work in the course of Pattern Recognition at PPGEE.

- Also constains a very simple benchmarking code, as well as the datasets used.

- The main implementation (*i.e.*, the `class` `GabrielGraph` and `GGClassifier`) was based on
the source code provided by the authors [3] in [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGClassification/).
